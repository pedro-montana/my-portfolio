      `OAKLAND, Calif. — Twitter took steps on Friday to slow the way information flows on its network, even changing some of its most basic features,
       as alarm grows that lies and calls for violence will sweep through social media in the weeks surrounding the presidential election.`,
      `The changes will temporarily alter the look and feel of Twitter. The company will essentially give users a timeout, for example, before
       they can hit the button to retweet a post from another account. And if users try to share content that Twitter has flagged as false, a notice
        will warn them that they are about to share inaccurate information.`,
      `Twitter also said it would add a label to claims about who won the election until it has been called by authoritative sources.`,
      `The steps announced on Friday are the most dramatic in a series of moves made by social media companies in recent months to stem
       the flow of misinformation in the lead-up to the Nov. 3 election, and are likely to draw the ire of Twitter’s most famous user, President Trump.`,

      `For a while now, Apple has been paying rewards to people who discover vulnerabilities in its software and services. The maximum amount is one million dollars, but in most cases the people who detect the security flaws receive are smaller amounts.`,

      `Apparently Apple has rewarded a group of five hackers (Sam Curry, Brett Buerhaus, Ben Sadeghipour, Samuel Erb and Tanner Barnes) the grand total of $51,500 dollars, which is equivalent to £39,780.`,
      
      `The group managed to find 55 vulnerabilities over a three-month period, of which 11 are described as critical. Among other things, a memory leak was discovered that could give unauthorized access to users data and a bug in iCloud that showed users full names.`,

      `People in Phoenix, Arizona will soon be able to order a driverless taxi, as Google expands its Waymo service.`,

     `Vehicles with no human driver on board were previously tested by a select group of Waymo customers, before the pandemic halted the service.`,
      
      `The driver-free cars will initially be available only to friends and family of those early Waymo adopters, but will extend to all app users within weeks.`,
      
      `The service comes two years later than originally promised.`,
      
      `The cars will be remotely monitored, with vehicle operators intervening in extreme circumstances - such as a road ahead being closed.`,
